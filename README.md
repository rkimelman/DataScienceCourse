# GeorgiaTechProject4-DataScienceCourse
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- I wrote the data cleaning lesson for a data science course that I designed with a team of 2 other students and Professor Ron Cytron.

- This course was designed to train incoming doctoral students in the Division of Computational and Data Sciences.

- The data analysis projects that I carried out in the process of designing the course have been left out for sake of brevity and to avoid redundancy.
